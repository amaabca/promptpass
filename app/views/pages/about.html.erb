    <h4>PROMPT PASS</h4>
    <p>Send secrets with secure two factor messaging.</p>

    <h4>What is two factor authentication?</h4>
    <p>We distribute the secret URL and access code using two 'factors' (email and sms in our case) and by combining them you're able to access your secret. By distributing
       this way it prevents unauthorized access who might have compromised either your email or phone.
       <br/><br/>The official definition can be found here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">Wikipedia Article</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>A secret is sent to Prompt Pass over a secure communication channel.</li>
      <li>Prompt Pass encrypts the secret with a combination of a salt and secret access code.</li>
      <li>An email and SMS containing the secret access code is sent to the recipient.</li>
      <li>The recipient visits the secret URL in the email and enters the secret access code from their phone.</li>
      <li>Pass Prompt uses the secret access code and the salt to decrypt the message and display it to the recipient.</li>
      <li>The secret message is destroyed after viewing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Secrets are encrypted with 256 bit encryption using the secret access code. 
        The only one to be able to decrypt the secret is the one with the secret access code. 
        Prompt Pass is unable to view any of the content within the secret messages.</li>
      <li>Brute force protection is applied when accessing the secret. After 5 invalid attempts the secret is destroyed.</li>
      <li>We do not have email/Google Analytics click or open tracking. We value your privacy.</li>
      <li>We don't store any of the messages or secret access codes in our logs.</li>
      <li>We're open source so you can review our code <a href="https://github.com/railsrumble/r15-team-193">here</a> to review our security for yourself.</li>
    </ul>
